# ACM Puzzle Hunt

This is the server used to run the ACM Puzzle Hunt. You'll need PostgreSQL and Redis installed and running. Make sure you have the `devconf.js` file and the database is set up according to the configuration in this file.

Then, clone this repo. The first time, you need to run 

```bash
$ npm install
```

and subsequently

```bash
$ npm start
```

to start the server. Finally, you can access the webpage locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
